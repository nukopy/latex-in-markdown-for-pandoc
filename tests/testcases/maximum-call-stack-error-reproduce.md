In this document, we derive the expectation, variance, and standard deviation from the definition of the normal distribution.

First, letâ€™s review the theorem for the expectation, variance, and standard deviation of a normal distribution.

\begin{thm*}

When a random variable $X$ follows a normal distribution $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ (i.e., $X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$), the expectation, variance, and standard deviation of $X$ are given as follows:

$$
E[X] = \mu, \qquad V(X) = \sigma^2, \qquad \sqrt{V(X)} = \sigma.
$$

\end{thm*}
